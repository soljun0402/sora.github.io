        <p><span class="title">Farewell My Concubine(1993)</span> is a film by <span class="title">Chen Kaige(1952-)</span>, based on the Peking Opera of the same name, depicting the story of <span class="title">Dieyi</span>, the main character who met the modern history of China from the 1920s to the 1970s. As the 'Fifth Generation' of film makers, Chen belongs to the generation that simultaneously experienced the Cultural Revolution and the 'reform era' of Deng Xiaoping. For he exhibited a critical view of the period, his work was censored at the time. In particular, Concubine was difficult to screen at the time of its release because it revealed topics that China wanted to criticize or hide, such as homosexuality (gender issue) and the Cultural Revolution.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The film begins in Beiping(or Beijing today),1925. As the story unfolds chronologically over 171 minutes,  it takes the form of denouncing the negative aspects of each period, but there is another aspect that  â€œfilm's central gestalt is essentially timeless." The beginning, development, crisis, climax, and ending correspond to some historical event- the Nationalist decade (1928-1937), Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), the Civil War between the Communists and the Nationalists (1946-1949), respectively. ), and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), -and the characters continue to be victims of various generations of violence.</p>

         <p>The reason why I brought this film as the main subject for discussing modernization is as follows.</p>
         <br>
         <p>1. The main materials discussed in class explain modernization based on important historical figures and events. However, I tried to analyze the story from an individual's point of view, especially when people facing the values of modernization.</p>
         <br>
         <p>2. The world has realized modernization at its own pace and in its own way. It is natural for collisions to occur in the process. However, China's Cultural Revolution was a large-scale self-destructive event that could not be found anywhere else in the world. Similar to the context in 1, I wanted to observe this event through the stories of people who were the real masters of the times, not centered on a few people who tried to change the times and innovate.</p>
         <br>
         <p>3. Analyzing the characteristics of each character in the film could lead to an understanding of modern China. In particular, the three figures analyzed above showed distinct differences in the face of turbulent times. Given that China's Modernization is ideologically related, Xiao Si is noteworthy. Even the people who took the lead in the construction of a new era do not know exactly what they are doing, and the fact that their essence is in satisfying individual greed is very different from China's totalitarian and socialist ideology. However, as a result, they constituted the same flow, and I think it is the most interesting thing considering the modernization.</p>
