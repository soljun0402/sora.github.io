        <p>In the winter of 1925, the prostitute leaves her son, <span class="title">Douzi</span>, at the prestigious Peking Opera Academy. At this time, when he is rejected by six fingers, the mother cuts off the child's finger without hesitation. The beginning of the story and the first loss is the fundamental pain of the Douzi. He is trained with Shitou for the roles of Yu and King of Chu.  During this period, he continued to change the lyrics of 'I am originally a girl, not a boy (我本来是个丫头，不是男孩子)', to 'I am originally a boy, not a girl' repeatedly and being punished. Finally, he accepts himself as an actor and sings with the original lyrics. This can be seen as the second loss of letting go of oneself. </p>
