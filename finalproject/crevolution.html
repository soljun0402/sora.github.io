        <p><span class="title">The Cultural Revolution</span> was an extreme socialist movement that took place from 1966 to 1976 during the reign of <span class="title">Mao Zedong</span>. The start of this case is the CCP's victory in civil war in 1949 and Mao's declaration of the People's Republic of China, followed by the deployment of the Great Leap Forward (1958 to early 1960's) for rapid development. Mao attempted rapid changes in heavy industry and agriculture with the goal of overtaking Britain in 15 years but failed miserably due to various environmental factors and opposition from people, and Mao resigned as president to take responsibility for this.</p>
        <br>
        <p>However, years later Mao Zedong plans to eliminate his successor, Liu Shaoqi. At this time, he started to win the support of students by using a model soldier named Lei Feng, and "called for support from rebellious students whom he designated as Red Guards. " Here Mao put forward the socialist ideology and condemned Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping as capitalists, so relatively highly valued the status of socialism. Thanks to this strategic support, the Red Guards carried on their iconic "little red book" and committed violence, destroying old objects, culture, and imports from the West. It drove millions of people to death. The beliefs of the violent subjects were strong. They firmly believed that they represented the Maoist faith, which could soon be put into practice by getting rid of old things, especially Four Olds - old ideas, old culture, old habits, and old customs. “This was the modern politics of the totalitarian state. ” But things began to improve when the People's Liberation Army (PLA), trying to stop the overheated violence, dismantled the Red Guard.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Cultural Revolution can be interpreted from a political perspective. In 1966–1969, Mao's wife Jiang Qing and new successor Lin Biao collaborated, and after Lin Biao failed his revolution, the 'Gang of Four' came to power until 1973. 'The Gang of Four' was arrested in 1976 on charges of attempting to seize power, and the Cultural Revolution ended.</p>
